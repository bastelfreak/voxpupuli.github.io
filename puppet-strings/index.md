[puppet-strings](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet-strings) is a gem that reads
Puppet code and annotations to create html documentations. It got created by
the awesome [Hailee Kenney](http://www.haileekenney.com/) and is actively
maintained by Puppet Inc. A few of our modules already have this enabled and
